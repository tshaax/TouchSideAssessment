# TouchSideAssessment
The project is a Console application that accepts text file and print out the following:
- Most frequent word: {word} occurred {x} times
- Most frequent 7-character word: {word} occurred {x} times
- Highest scoring word(s) (according to the score table): {word} with a score of {x}ry inste

# Performance 
The project uses dictionaries instead of using arrays because it lookups at items based on a key value and not by index.
